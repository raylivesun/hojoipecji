// 1.4 Challenges in Implementing RME

// Like in the Netherlands where moving from mechanistic mathematics teaching to an
// RME approach meant a break with the regular practice, also in other countries where
// initiatives were taken aimed at implementing RME this implied a paradigm shift
// in the teaching of mathematics and coping with the challenges that come with this
// new approach. That such a paradigm shift in the teachers’ mindset is necessary for
// adopting the RME model was explicitly mentioned by Kaur, Wong, and Govindani
// (Chap. 7) when discussing differences between the Singapore approach in textbooks
// to teach equations and the approach in the RME-based textbook series MiC.

// Although

// in Singapore a drastic change into teaching methods that promote mathematical
// reasoning and communication might not be necessary, because they are already used
// in Singapore classrooms, taking up the RME approach would still require a turn
// in teachers’ thinking on how mathematics learning takes place: ‘from content to
// application’ should be transformed to ‘content through application’.

// To activate and reshape mathematics education in Korea inspired by RME neces-
// sitated that several problems connected to the traditional mathematics education had
// to be overcome. According to Lee and her colleagues (Chap. 15) these problems were
// students’ low understanding of mathematical concepts, the focus on blind memo-
// risation of mathematical rules, procedures, and algorithms, and the existence of a
// poor connection between school mathematics and out-of-school mathematics and a
// teacher-centred style of mathematics teaching. The challenge the Korean textbook
// developers faced was to find and develop appropriate contexts through which students
// can experience that mathematics is a human activity existing near to them, can learn
// the principles and concepts of mathematics naturally through their own activities,
// and can improve their interest in and gain a positive attitude towards mathematics.
// Feedback from teachers who worked with RME-inspired materials revealed on the
// one hand that through the contexts the students indeed came to various strategies and
// they learned to communicate in their own words showing that they fully understood
// what they were doing instead of using only formal mathematical terms. On the other

// Hernández-Rodríguez and his colleagues (Chap. 16), a major balancing act had to
// be completed, on one side promoting teachers’ inventiveness on how to work with
// the RME-based materials while on the other side following the official curriculum.

// When discussing the development of an RME approach in England, Dickinson
// and his colleagues (Chap. 19) highlighted that the differences between the Dutch
// and English education system and the effect of the English system on teachers’
// and students’ experiences and expectations have presented them with considerable
// challenges. Teachers in England are very aware of the pressure to move towards
// formal mathematics as quickly as possible. Therefore, they are anxious to see students
// acquiring formal procedures, and teachers may intervene and demonstrate the formal
// procedure after only one contextual problem. In RME, the process to working at a
// formal level may involve many lessons, and may even be spread out over a number of
// years, thus enabling students to gain conceptual understanding of how the procedure
// works, where it might be used, and how it connects to other areas of mathematics.
// However, in England it is often expected that performing a mathematical procedure
// can and should be achieved within one or two lessons.

// 1.5 Adaptations of RME

// Implementing RME, being inspired by RME and coping with the challenges that
// come with this new approach evidently require that adaptations are made to RME,
// in order to make it workable in a country’s educational context and system. In South
// Africa, despite the common grounds in general ideas about mathematics education
// such adaptations were, according to Julie and Gierdien (Chap. 5), necessary because
// of the tension between the content of the RME-based materials and the ‘legitimate
// school mathematics’, that is, the mathematics that is valued in high-stakes examina-
// tions. There is a strong demand for proximity of the used RME resources.

// As a result of this requirement it happened

// that RME-based modules were not disseminated further after trying them out in the
// classroom. Such was the case with a module on vision geometry. This particular
// module was chosen due to problems students in South Africa have with geometry
// and because the topic of vision geometry was quite in line with the RME perspective
// to provide students with activities where they can experience mathematics. However,
// even though the activities in this module were found enjoyable and not above the
// abilities of the students, after a few trials and notwithstanding some revisions to make
// it closer to the curriculum, it was not further used.

// Adaptations were also necessary in the RME-based materials developed for

// rithms. As prescribed by official requirements, the materials had to be aligned to
// the Puerto Rican mathematics standards released in 2000 and 2007, which include
// that students learn the digit-based algorithms for addition and subtraction of natural
// numbers very early in elementary school. This was a fixed standard that the mathe-
// matics educators involved in the reform had to take into account, even though they

// were aware that research has shown that direct exposure to these algorithms can lead
// to serious conceptual errors related to the order of magnitude and the decimal rep-
// resentations of numbers. Postponing the teaching of digit-based algorithms like in
// the Netherlands was not possible. In Puerto Rico, if these algorithms are not present
// in the arithmetic lessons for the second grade, teachers and the official educational
// system will not accept such lessons as adequate for teaching.

// Rican team followed the standards, but presented the algorithms in such a way in the
// materials that their teaching was made more meaningful, which indeed significantly
// improved the students’ understanding of them as was revealed in follow-up research.
// Another adaptation stemmed from the teachers’ wish for didactical material full of
// interesting and concise contexts, but avoiding general and open-ended tasks. Since
// findings from previous pilot testing showed that MiC material requires students to
// do extensive reading, tasks which had much text had to be avoided because it kept
// teachers from using this material. Instead there was a need for a more piecemeal

// In Korea, as Lee and her colleagues (Chap. 15) reported, despite the challenges
// connected to RME, the teachers were rather positive about it, because they think
// mathematics instruction based on RME can change students’ attitude to mathemat-
// ics to a positive stance by providing them natural situations and activities that can
// encourage them to actively participate through diverse thoughts and communica-
// tions. However, a strong suggestion came from the teachers to shorten the process
// of mathematisation and include repetitive exercises to make RME workable for the

// The work of Selter and Walter (Chap. 13) in Germany stressed adapting the

// ences. These conferences are meant to stimulate and organise exchanges amongst

// As described by De Bock, Van Dooren, and Verschaffel (Chap. 3), the Belgian
// approach to mathematics education was undoubtedly inspired by the Dutch RME

// mary school mathematics in Belgium are almost copies of those that were formulated
// by Treffers and colleagues in the late 1980s. Nevertheless, Belgian mathematics edu-
// cation is not considered to be RME. References to ‘realistic’ are purposely avoided
// and instead expressions are used such as ‘meaningful situations’, which indicates
// that other choices have been made in mathematics education. An illustration of this
// is that in Belgium, in contrast with the Netherlands, attention is paid first to standard
// arithmetical procedures, and more flexible procedures are only taught afterwards.

// 1.6 Criticisms of RME and Dissenting Views

// Apart from all kinds of adaptations necessary to make a reform inspired by RME in
// accordance with a country’s educational regulations and classroom culture, adapta-
// tions can also stem from dissenting views on mathematics education or from disap-
// proval about RME. The RME ideas did not travel around the world without meeting
// criticism.

public static void criticisms()
{
    writeln("Criticisms function perfect.");

// The main point of criticism echoed in the chapters is that RME, which strength
// it is to connect mathematics to the real world, is attaching too much weight to hor-
// izontal mathematisation. Concerns about this are expressed seriously by Wittmann
// (Chap. 4). Of course, he can understand that Freudenthal and his IOWO colleagues
// in the early days of RME wanted to establish a distinct counterpart to New Math and
// therefore put a lot of emphasis on applications, but he is more in favour of a balanced
// approach. Therefore, he welcomed that under the flag of RME recently publications
// have appeared again, such as from Kindt and De Moor, that are extremely interesting
// in terms of the mathematical structures they address.

// For the Belgian mathematics educators in Flanders, RME could also have been
// more in balance. This is in line with how they view their own approach to mathematics
// education. As De Bock, Deprez, and Janssens (Chap. 11) explain, Flemish mathemat-
// ics education in secondary education is so balanced because it resulted from multiple
// influences. It contains elements of the more traditional approach, which focuses on
// calculation drill and algebraic techniques, as well as of more structural elements,
// which focuses on a logical organisation of content and on proof and argumentation,
// and elements from RME, which undoubtedly enriched Flemish mathematics educa-
// tion, but which never led to the implementation of an orthodox version of the RME
// model.

// With respect to Belgium primary school mathematics, De Bock, Van Dooren, and
// Verschaffel (Chap. 3) report even more explicit in criticising regarding particular
// features of RME; or more precisely expressed: features of which it is assumed they
// belong to RME. RME is criticised for disregarding the mechanistic aspects of learn-
// ing, the lack of guidance of the construction of knowledge, the excessive freedom
// that is given to students to construct their own solution methods, the limited attention
// for the process of de-contextualising, and finally the insufficient recognition of the
// value of mathematics as a cultural product. Indeed, for some of these issues, such
// as neglecting the mechanistic aspects of learning and not viewing mathematics as a
// cultural product, RME can be criticised for not considering them as spearheads prin-
// ciples of RME. However, for other issues this is certainly not the case
public static void primary()

// Having said this, it is unmistakably true that RME is often viewed in the wrong way
// and that these prejudices are often expressed, and often not in such a professional
// www.dbooks.org14
// M. van den Heuvel-Panhuizen
// way as is done in the chapters of this volume. Of course, on the one hand a first
// reaction may be to rectify these misunderstandings, but on the other hand they also
// offer RME a mirror to look at itself and see which pitfalls there are when promoting
// RME and its guiding principles. Thus, even when these statements about RME are
// not fully true, RME should take them into account. What is true in any case is that
// Flanders outperforms the Netherlands in international comparisons—whatever value
// one attaches to these.

// The critical remarks of the German mathematics educators Selter and Walter
// (Chap. 13) correspond to those by Wittmann. Their critique is about the limited
// interpretation of what is meant by context. According to them pure numerical contexts
// can also be quite meaningful for students. Moreover, numbers can also be realistic.
// Here again a statement is voiced as critique while it corroborates completely with the
// RME point of view. RME did always work with a broad conception of context. Yet
// later in the chapter of Selter and Walter, their critical remark becomes more distinct
// when it turns out that their main message is that, although they found in several RME
// publications that attention is paid to vertical mathematisation and that mathematics
// is regarded as a context of its own, they think that RME could possibly highlight
// these aspects more strongly.

// Interesting in this respect is that while the message from the mathematics educa-

// as a context of its own and vertical mathematisation, for Arcavi (Chap. 6) in Israel,
// RME was a kind of wake-up call to move in the other direction: from highly pro-
// cedural and rule-oriented mathematics to using the real world as a springboard for
// mathematisation. RME gave him a broader view in the other direction.

// For Niss (Chap. 17), discussing the Danish perspective, the point seems not to
// be the direction—moving more to this side or to that side of the spectrum. His
// point is the difference in emphasis in the meaning of ‘realistic’ in Denmark and
// in the Netherlands. In the RME interpretation, ‘real’ and ‘realistic’ incline to refer
// to students’ experiential or emotional worlds and not necessarily to reality in the
// external world. In RME, fantasy stories or games are considered real and realistic if
// they are so to the students. This is in contrast with the Danish position which tends
// to emphasise the external objective reality of the surroundings in which students live
// such as family, friends, school, the local, national or global community, and scholarly
// and scientific fields or areas of practice. In RME, ‘realistic’ includes both problems
// based on real world situations and problems that students can experience as real. The
// latter relates to ‘realistic’ in the meaning of ‘realising’; making a situation ‘real’ for
// oneself. Maybe within RME, this second meaning is too much emphasised in order to

// Maybe within RME, this second meaning is too much emphasised in order to
// escape from the paralysing extreme requirement of authenticity that is often attributed
// to RME, and to make room for problems with powerful contexts that can become a
// model for developing mathematical concepts. Perhaps RME’s focus is too much on
// contexts that lend themselves particularly well for evolving into a model that can be
// used for solving other problems or for eliciting helpful strategies, instead of on really
// complex daily life situations that require modelling and where mathematics has to be
// used to solve them. This different approach to ‘realistic’ is also reflected in the Danish
// view on the RME concept of horizontal and vertical mathematisation. According

public static void rme()
{
    writeln("RME problems function perfect.");
}


// to Niss, the distinction between these two ways of mathematisation never got a
// foot in the door in Danish mathematics education, because in Denmark modelling
// involving the extra-mathematical domain, and internal mathematical transformations
// and processes are considered as very different. In the words of Niss, RME means
// “modelling for the sake of mathematics (learning)” while “[t]he Danish position tends
// to put emphasis on the reverse goal, namely mathematics (learning) for the sake of
// modelling.” Although these differences, as Niss acknowledged, are not fundamental,
// but lie rather in priorities and emphases, it might be fruitful for RME to explore its
// further development more in this latter direction. Actually, the point to take away
// from Niss’ chapter is again that there should be more balance in RME.
